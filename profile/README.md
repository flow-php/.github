Flow is a PHP based, strongly typed ETL (Extract Transform Load), asynchronous data processing library with constant memory consumption. 

## Usage

**Extract** from the Source, **Transform**, **Load** to the Sink. 

```php
<?php

use Flow\ETL\DSL\From;
use Flow\ETL\DSL\Transform;
use Flow\ETL\DSL\To;
use Flow\ETL\Flow;
use Flow\ETL\Memory\ArrayMemory;
use Flow\ETL\Row\Sort;
use Flow\ETL\Rows;

$array = new ArrayMemory();

(new Flow())
    ->read(From::rows(new Rows(...)))
    ->rows(Transform::keep(['id', 'name', 'status']))
    ->sortBy(Sort::desc('status'))
    ->write(To::memory($array);
```

The reasons behind creating this project can be explained in few [tweets](https://twitter.com/norbert_tech/status/1484863793280786439?s=21). 
To get familiar with basic ETL Api, please look into [flow-php/etl repository](https://github.com/flow-php/etl), everything else is listed below. 

### [Usage Examples](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-examples)

## Features

* constant memory consumption
* asynchronous data processing
* caching
* reading from any data source
* writing to any data source
* rich collection of data transformation functions
* grouping & aggregating
* remote files processing 
* joins
* sorting 
* displaying datasets as ASCII table
* validation against schema

## Asynchronous Processing

* [etl-adapter-reactphp](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-adapter-reactphp)

## Building blocks

* DataFrame - Lazy data processing frame. 
* Rows - Immutable colllection of `Row` objects. 
* Row - Immutable, strongly typed collection of `Entry` objects. 
* Entry - Immutable, stronly typed object representing cell in a row. 
* **E**xtractor (Reader) - Memory safe, Data Source returning \Generator, yielding `Rows` to the `Pipeline`
* **T**ransformer - Data transformer receiving and returning `Rows` (in most cases transformer), one instance of `Rows` at once.  
* **L**oader (Writer) - Memory safe representation of Data Sink, responsibility of Loader is to write `Rows` into destination storage, one at time. 
* Pipeline - Interface representing ETL process, each received `Rows` instanced is pased through all `Pipes`, also responsible for error handling. 
* Pipe - Loader of Transformer instance existing in `Pipes` collection.  

### Supported PHP versions

* 8.1 - âœ…

## Transfomers

Flow ETL provides a rich set of official transfomers, please find them all in [flow-php/etl](https://github.com/flow-php/etl/#transformers) 
repository.

## Available Adapters: 

The role of adapter is usually to provide Extractors and Loaders, occasionally adapters might also bring some specific Transformers.
