# Flow PHP 

Flow is a PHP based, strongly typed (on data but also on API level) ETL (Extract Transform Load) framework. 

The reasons behind creating this project can be explained in few [tweets](https://twitter.com/norbert_tech/status/1484863793280786439?s=21). 

By default ETL is a synchronouse, memory safe process. 
In some cases, it might become handy to process data asynchronously, Flow is not yet fully ready for it but we are doing good progress with [etl-async](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-async) abstraction and [reactphp adapter](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-async-adapter-reactphp).

To get familiar with basic ETL Api, please look into [flow-php/etl repository](https://github.com/flow-php/etl), everything else is listed below. 

### Building blocks

* Rows - Immutable colllection of `Row` objects. 
* Row - Immutable, strongly typed collection of `Entry` objects. 
* Entry - Immutable, stronly typed object representing cell in a row. 
* **E**xtractor - Memory safe, Data Source returning \Generator, yielding `Rows` to the `Pipeline`
* **T**ransformer - Data transformer receiving and returning `Rows` (in most cases transformer), one instance of `Rows` at once.  
* **L**oader - Memory safe representation of Data Sink, responsibility of Loader is to write `Rows` into destination storage, one at time. 
* Pipeline - Interface representing ETL process, each received `Rows` instanced is pased through all `Pipes`, also responsible for error handling. 
* Pipe - Loader of Transformer instance existing in `Pipes` collection.  

### Supported PHP versions

* 7.4 - âœ…
* 8.0 - âœ…
* 8.1 - âš™ (work in progress)

### Transfomers

Flow ETL provides a rich set of official transfomers, please find them all in [flow-php/etl](https://github.com/flow-php/etl/#transformers) 
repository.

### Available Adapters: 

The role of adapter is usually to provide Extractors and Loaders, occasionally adapters might also bring some specific Transformers.
